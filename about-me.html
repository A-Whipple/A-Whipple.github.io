					<h1>Digital Designer</h1>
					<p class="heading-body-copy">My passions lie in creating fun and unique projects for people and businesses. I have a love for enlglish, specifically creative writing and the ways that language can be used to communicate large ideas like emotions or concepts, and artwork that connects with the viewer on a visceral level. My goals are to provide for my family and I by working with people to create projects they want, such as unique and interesting posters, webistes, works of art, or stories. I like to meet face to face to really get to know and understand what I can do for you, but if not then emails or phone calls work just fine too. I like to include a random fun fact at the end to help you remember me by, such as I have previously held my breath for just over four and a half minutes.</p>
